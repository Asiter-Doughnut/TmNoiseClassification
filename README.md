> Deep Learning Project for Sound Classification Based on ECAPA-TDNN

#### Description

After a period of studying machine learning techniques, IAfter a period of studying machine learning techniques, I
decided to make my own deep learning project for sound classification. The name is TieMClassification.

## Implementation Steps

1. Prepare the dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3. Build ecapa-tdnn model
4. Train the model
5. Apply the model

## Model deployment correlation

> the ecapa_tdnn_80.model is my train result.The next time I need to step up in RockChip board.

Now want to deploy on the RockChip board.But no support pytorch.Now I need some toolkit help my model change to knn
model and setup in the RockChip board.
This is official description by [knn toolkit](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rknn-toolkit2?tab=readme-ov-file).
