> Deep Learning Project for Sound Classification Based on ECAPA-TDNN

#### Description

After a period of studying machine learning techniques, IAfter a period of studying machine learning techniques, I
decided to make my own deep learning project for sound classification. The name is TieMClassification.

## Implementation Steps

1. Prepare the dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3. Build ecapa-tdnn model
4. Train the model
5. Apply the model
